Abstract
Multi-agent pathnding (MAPF) remains a critical problem
inroboticsandautonomoussystems,whereagentsmustnav-
igate shared spaces efciently while avoiding conicts. Tra-
ditional centralized algorithms that have global information,
such as Conict-Based Search (CBS), provide high-quality
solutions but become computationally expensive in large-
scalescenariosduetothecombinatorialexplosionofconicts
that need resolution. Conversely, distributed approaches that
have local information, particularly learning-based methods,
offer better scalability by operating with relaxed information
availability, yet often at the cost of solution quality. To ad-
dress these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that
combinesdecentralizedpathplanningwithalightweightcen-
tralized coordinator. Our framework leverages reinforcement
learning (RL) for decentralized planning, enabling agents to
adapt their planning based on minimal, targeted alertsŒsuch
asstaticconict-cellagsorbriefconicttracksŒthataredy-
namicallysharedinformationfromthecentralcoordinatorfor
effective conict resolution. We empirically study the effect
of the information available to an agent on its planning per-
formance. Our approach reduces the inter-agent information
sharing compared to fully centralized and distributed meth-
ods, while still consistently nding feasible, collision-free
solutionsŒeven in large-scale scenarios having higher agent
counts.
1 Introduction
Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) addresses the funda-
mentalchallengeofcomputingcollision-freetrajectoriesfor
multiple agents navigating a shared environment. Its effec-
tive solving is crucial for deploying a wide array of multi-
agent systems, from automated warehouses and robotic
swarms to autonomous vehicle coordination (Sharon et al.
2015). Despite its practical signicance, MAPF is compu-
tationally demanding, classied as NP-hard in its general
form, which can render traditional centralized search meth-
odsintractableasthenumberofagentsorthecomplexityof
the environment increases (Ren et al. 2025; Sartoretti et al.
2019).
Extensive research in MAPF has explored various coor-
dination paradigms, each with different implications for in-
formation availability and system performance. Centralized

yarskietal.2015),typicallyassumefullobservabilityofthe

partial observability in dynamic settings. For example, PRI-
MAL (Sartoretti et al. 2019) trains agents to plan using
partial views, learning implicit coordination, while meth-
odslikeFOLLOWER(Skrynniketal.2024)reduceexplicit
communication by relying on global heuristic maps. These
decentralized methods improve scalability but may reduce

solution quality and leave conicts unresolved due to lim-
itedinformation.
To address these limitations, we propose a novel hy-
brid MAPF framework that combines decentralized plan-
ning with a lightweight centralized coordinator, focusing
on minimizing inter-agent information sharing while main-
taining solution feasibility. Our ndings show that minimal,
targeted alerts are sufcient, reducing the total information
load by an estimated

93%
compared to a continuous-
observationdistributedparadigm(seeAppendixA.1).Inour
approach, agents primarily rely on decentralized, reinforce-
mentlearning-basedneuralnetworkplannersthatoperateon
local observations (e.g., position coordinates), eliminating
the need for global information as well as local egocentric
maps. A central coordinator oversees agent trajectories, in-
tervening selectively by dynamically sharing targeted infor-
mation to prompt localized re-planning when conicts are
anticipated. This work's contributions are centered on this

Given the observation constraints of a decen-

with one agent knowing nothing about other agents? If not,
what information must it need at a minimum? and

How does the proposed hybrid method compare to leading

, considers that an agent, upon reaching its goal, remains
at that vertex until all other agents in the team have also
reached their respective targets. This waiting agent contin-
ues to occupy its target vertex, potentially causing conicts

2.2 CoordinationParadigms
AsformalizedbySharonetal.(Sharonetal.2015),solution
approaches to MAPF problems can be categorized based
on their coordination strategy. We extend this by focusing
on three key elements: state observability (global vs. local),
communication (allowed vs. none), and control (centralized
vs. decentralized). In
centralized
paradigms, a global plan-
ner with full observability of the entire state controls all
agents, and communication is implicit through this central
controller. By contrast, other approaches grant agents local
control over their actions. Within this category, we draw a
key distinction based on communication: In
distributed
ap-
proaches, agents that plan their own paths are allowed to
explicitly exchange information, such as local observations,
intended paths, or goals, with other agents to achieve coop-
erative behavior. In
decentralized
MAPF, as dened in this
work, inter-agent communication during execution is elim-
inated. Agents plan and act entirely independently, relying
only on their own local information. Finally,
hybrid
frame-
works, like the one we propose, combine these elements.
They typically employ a central coordination mechanism
that has full observability to detect conicts and selectively
intervene, while agents otherwise plan in a decentralized
manner. In our work, we adopt a hybrid framework with a
customized information sharing mechanism as described in
Section3.
2.3 LiteratureReview
Search-based Methods:
Research on MAPF has evolved
from centralized to more scalable methods. Early ad-
vancements include
M

, which dynamically couples agent
searches upon conict for optimality and completeness
(WagnerandChoset2011),andIncreasingCostTreeSearch
(ICTS), which employs cost allocation and then checks for
conict-freesolutionsfromsetsofsingle-agentpaths,yield-
ing signicant speedups over joint-space search (Sharon
et al. 2013). A pivotal development was CBS, where agents
independently plan paths using
A

, and a centralized detec-
tor resolves conicts by branching with new constraints for
involved agents, ensuring optimality (Sharon et al. 2015).
To enhance scalability while preserving optimality, variants
suchasICBSintegratecardinalityheuristicsandmeta-agent

merging to accelerate convergence (Boyarski et al. 2015).
For very large instances, suboptimal repair strategies like
LargeNeighborhoodSearch(LNS)generateinitialsolutions
(often via prioritized planning) and iteratively repair collid-
ing agent subsets under a centralized control loop (Li et al.
2022). However, these methods face scalability challenges
as the number of agents increases and often depend on ex-
tensiveglobalinformationforcoordination.
Learning-based Methods:
In parallel, learning-based
approaches address partial observability and communica-
tion constraints. PRIMAL and PRIMAL2 train decentral-
ized policies via a combination of imitation learning from
an expert centralized planner and reinforcement learning
(PRIMAL2 enhancing local observations for better coor-
dination), effectively implementing a centralized training
and decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm (Sartoretti
et al. 2019; Damani et al. 2021b). SCRIMP introduces a
transformer-based communication module enabling agents
with limited elds of view to coordinate effectively, achiev-
ing decentralized coordination without a central execution-
time coordinator (Wang et al. 2023). To function in real-
world settings, each agent must carry onboard sensing,
e.g., RGB-D cameras or LiDAR scanners, and implement
an inter-agent communication protocol for goal disclosure,
which introduces additional computational overhead and
raises privacy concerns. While offering adaptability and de-
centralized execution, learning-based methods can require
signicant training data, may struggle with generalization,
and often provide weaker guarantees on solution quality or
completenesswhenrelyingpurelyonlocalinformation.
Hybrid Methods:
Hybrid planning-learning paradigms
seekthestrengthsofbothworlds.Authorsin(Skrynniketal.
2024) introduce FOLLOWER, which involves each agent
using a congestion-aware
A

planner to determine its sub-
goals, then executing a fully decentralized RL policy for
lifelong replanning. More recently, hybrid frameworks like
LNS2+RL, introduced by Li et al., have emerged, augment-
ing LNS by employing MARL for early, localized conict
resolution, then relying on efcient search-based planning
for nal renement (Wang et al. 2025). These existing hy-
brid approaches, while innovative, can involve complex in-
tegrations and may still face trade-offs between optimality,
scalability,orspecicinformationdependencies(likeglobal
congestionmaps(Skrynniketal.2024)).
ToenableastructuredcomparisonofdiverseMAPFtech-
niques(search-based,learning-based,andhybrid),weadopt
the four-stage MAPF pipeline: S1 (Agent Planning), S2
(Collision Detection), S3 (Collision Avoidance Policy), and
S4 (Agent Replanning). Within this structure, CBS uses
decentralized A* search for S1/S4 and centralized high
level solver for collision resolution in S2/S3 for optimality
(Sharon et al. 2015). LNS employs a centralized loop for
all four stages, managing path generation, detection, repair,
and subset replanning, thereby trading optimality for scal-
ability (Li et al. 2022). Learning-based planners like PRI-
MAL and SCRIMP typically use local observations for de-
centralized S1-S4 execution, coordinating without a central
controller (Sartoretti et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2023); how-
ever, practical deployments can require sensors (eg., cam-
era,LiDARetc.)andcommunication,addingcomputational
overheadandincreasesensingcost.Hybridmethodssuchas
FOLLOWERuseglobalcongestionmapswith

S1, then decentralized RL policy for S2-S4, often without

applies centralized LNS for S1-S3, while S4 uses a hybrid
policy (MARL or prioritized planning) for subsets, balanc-
ingkeytrade-offs(Wangetal.2025).RefertoTable2inthe
Appendix Section A.2 for a detailed categorization of these
methodologies.
Together, these works highlight key limitations of exist-
ing MAPF paradigms: centralized methods face scalabil-
ity and privacy concerns; purely learning-based approaches
compromise solution quality; and current hybrid solutions
often still depend on signicant centralized communication
or coordination overhead with higher sensing cost. The hy-

3 Methodology
3.1 ApproachSummary
We propose a hybrid coordination framework that lever-
ages decentralized RL-based path planning together with
centralized collision detection and control. While conceptu-
ally similar to the high-level loop of Conict-Based Search
(CBS), our framework differs signicantly in its resolution
step:itdoesnotbuildaconstrainttreeorperformbacktrack-
ing, instead issuing targeted alerts that prompt heuristic-
based replanning from the local RL agent. The proposed
method'sfour-stageMAPFpipelineisdetailedbelow.

The information guiding the replanningŒwhether it con-

).
Our hybrid MAPF framework manages a precise ow of
information,essentialtosupportourclaimsofreducedinfor-
mation sharing and adaptive planning. The process begins
with fully decentralized agent planning (S1), where each
RL-driven agent uses only its local information before sub-
mitting its intended path
ˆ
k
to a central coordinator. This
coordinator, leveraging its global observation of all submit-
ted paths, performs collision detection (S2) to identify the
set of all potential conicts
C
(
ˆ;˝
)
. Following detection,
the central control module (S3) issues targeted alerts; it se-
lects a specic agent
a
c
k
and determines the rewind point
t
j

r
from which the agent must replan, effectively issu-
ing an alert
A
(

)
. S3 also governs the level of informa-
tiontobesharedforthesubsequentdecentralizedreplanning
(S4). Initially, the alerted agent
a
c
k
attempts to resolve the
conict using minimal information, typically by treating its
own conicting path segment

c
as a static obstacle (S4.1).
If this localized, low-information approach proves insuf-
cient, S3 then shares additional information with the agentŒ
specically, a subset ofthe path of other directly conicting
agentsŒfor a more informed replan (S4.2). This tiered strat-
egyŠfrom purely local information in S1, to targeted alerts
fromS3,andthentoprogressivelydetailedyetstilllocalized
conict information for S4Šensures that inter-agent infor-
mation sharing is demand-driven and sparse. Agents com-
municate their revised plans
ˆ

k
back to the coordinator,
and this iterative cycle of detection and selective, adaptive
replanning continues until a globally conict-free solution
is achieved (

In our pro-

the four cardinal directions (e.g., Up, Down, Left, Right,

Reward Structure
Our reward function, similar to PRI-
MAL (Sartoretti et al. 2019), promotes efcient, collision-
free navigation and discourages unproductive behaviors.
Agents receive +20 for reaching the goal. Penalties include:
-3forcollisionswithobstacles,-2fortimeout,-0.02pertime
step taken (to encourage efciency), and -0.1 for a `WAIT'
action, a penalty that encourages path progression over sta-
tionarywaiting.Anadditional-0.05penaltyisappliedifthe

4 ExperimentalSetup
In this section we rst describe how we train the per-agent
navigation policy used in stage S1, then detail the maps,
problem instances, and competing planners used to evalu-
ate stages S2ŒS4, and dene the performance metrics used
toevaluate.
Training Procedure
We train a parametrized RL model
Q

(
s;a
)
using the DDQN algorithm(Van Hasselt, Guez,
andSilver2016),incorporatingprioritizedexperiencereplay
(PER) and
"
-greedy exploration, to enable an agent to navi-
gatetoaspeciedgoalinthepresenceofbothstaticanddy-
namic obstacles. Each dynamic obstacle possesses a hidden
goal and follows precomputed trajectories, executing only
valid moves; this allows for the simulation of online col-
lision alerts during inference from the S3 stage. Training is
performedfor
30000
episodesonan

each episode capped at a maximum of
T
max
= 50
steps.
The curriculum for environmental complexity is scheduled

Input observations are normalized to zero mean and

are stored in a prioritized experience re-
play buffer of size

. At each learning step, a mini-batch
of

transitions is sampled. The agent selects actions us-
ing an

only actions

In addition to the DDQN model, a Proximal Policy Op-
timization (PPO) based model was also trained; details re-
garding its architecture (including the one used for DDQN
model) and training procedure, along with comparative per-
formance, are provided in the Appendix Section A.3. The
DDQN model was selected due to its superior performance
overthePPOmodel-resultsarepresentedinTable3.
Evaluation Scenarios and Baselines
We evaluate our
framework's performance and scalability across three dis-
tinct grid congurations, representing two primary map
types: maze and warehouse. All evaluations use ten ran-
domly generated problem instances per conguration. For
themazemaptype,wetestonan

gridwithapprox-
imately 45% static obstacles (5 to 20 agents) and a larger
21

21
grid with approximately 35% static obstacles (32,
64, and 96 agents). For the warehouse map type, we uti-
lize a
25

25
grid layout with approximately 24% static
obstacles as shelves (32, 64, and 96 agents). Our proposed
hybrid framework is evaluated through two variants, Alert-
BFS and Alert-A*, which are named based on their RL pol-
icyrolloutstrategy(
Breadth-FirstSearch
or
weightedA-star
search
, respectively). The impact of our specic replanning
strategies is further analyzed in an ablation study in Ap-
pendix Table 5. These are compared against search-based
planners, Conict-Based Search (CBS) (Sharon et al. 2015)
andImprovedCBS(ICBS)(Boyarskietal.2015),andlead-

ing learning-based online planners PRIMAL (Damani et al.
2021a)andSCRIMP(Wangetal.2023)withtheMAPFfor-
mulation of

ants operate within our proposed four-stage pipeline (S1Œ
S4), the baseline methods are executed as standalone algo-
rithms. Per-instance time limits are 50 seconds for

PerformanceCriteria
WeevaluateourMAPFframework
using standard metrics.
Success Rate (SR)
is the proportion
of instances solved within dened time limits. For success-
ful instances,
Makespan (MS)
measures the time until the
last agent reaches its goal. The number of
Collisions (CO)
measuresthetotalcountofpathdisagreementsdetectedand
successfully resolved by the framework to produce the nal
collision-free solution. A non-zero CO in a successful run
reects the planner's total conict resolution workload. Fi-
nally, total
Time (T)
measures the computational cost until
a solution is found or the time limit is exceeded. Learning-
basedmethodsareevaluatedbytheaveragenumberofsteps
takenintheenvironment.
5 ResultsandDiscussion
Here we present an empirical study, evaluating our central
hypothesis:
a MAPF framework with strategically reduced
information sharing can achieve robust performance.
We
addressour
RQs
concerningminimalinformationneedsand
comparative performance against approaches with different
information paradigms using the experimental results pre-
sentedinTable1.
(RQ1):
Given the observation constraints of a decentral-
izedsetup,cananeffectiveMAPFalgorithmbecreatedwith
one agent knowing nothing about other agents? If not, what
informationmustitneedataminimum?
Ans.
NoŠifagents
have zero knowledge of one another, MAPF fails, losing
completenessguarantees;butsolutionsarepossiblewithtar-
geted,minimalinformationsharing.Table5intheappendix
presentscomparativeresultsforvariousinter-agentinforma-
tionsharingsettings.
Now, we turn our attention to the strategically limited
minimalinformationsharingcase.Inourframework,strate-
gicallyinformedalertsconveyeither(S4.1)staticconstraints
(the conicting cell) or (S4.2) slightly richer, yet still local-
ized, dynamic constraints (the sub-path of only the directly
conicting agent(s) for a short horizon). Table 1 shows per-
formance comparison of considered methodologies across
11x11 maze (a), 21x21 maze (b), and
25

25
(c) ware-
house maps, respectively. As shown in Table 1, the perfor-
mance of our framework, where agents initially plan with
only local information and receive minimal, targeted alerts
fromacentralcoordinatoruponconict,achieveshighSuc-
cess Rates (SR). Specically, on the
11

11
and
21

21
maze grids, SRs are high (90%-100%). On the more struc-
tured
25

25
warehouse map (Table 1c), Alert-BFS and
Alert-A* also achieve 100% SR for 32 and 64 agents, with
Alert-A* maintaining a 60% SR in the dense agent scenario
(96agents),demonstratingeffectivenessacrossdifferenten-
vironmenttypeswiththisminimalinformationsharingstrat-
egy.Thissuccesswithminimalinter-agentinformationcon-
trasts sharply with alternatives. Centralized planners (
CBS
,
ICBS
) demand
complete global knowledge
of all agents'
paths, a requirement that, while enabling optimality, leads
to their low SR due to the combinatorial explosion in con-
ict resolution within practical time limits. In contrast, dis-
tributed learning frameworks (
PRIMAL
&
SCRIMP
) often
operate under the assumption that each planning agent pos-
sesses
full observation, of other agents and their goals, in
a local eld of view
. While this localized observation can
facilitatedecentralizeddecision-making,itimpliesacontin-
uous and potentially substantial information gathering (e.g.,
via onboard cameras or LiDAR sensors) and processing re-
quirementforeachagent.
The success of our method across maze and warehouse
environments underscores that this on-demand information
is sufcient for high SR, thereby avoiding the continuous,
dense local information exchange. Our quantitative anal-
ysis, detailed in the Appendix A.1, shows that this on-
demand alert mechanism reduces the total information load
by
˘
93%
comparedtoacontinuous-observationdistributed
paradigminthisscenario.
(RQ2):
Howdoestheproposedhybridmethodcompareto
leading alternative search- and learning-based approaches
in terms of performance, solution quality, and scalability?
Ans.
Our hybrid framework exhibits a compelling bal-
ance of performance and scalability with distinct trade-offs
against established search-based and learning-based meth-
ods,asdetailedinTable1.
Our Python-based framework demonstrates higher SR
and scalability compared to search-based optimal solvers.
CBS/ICBS
(C++ based) shows constantly lower SR with in-
creasing environment complexity, failing to solve any in-
stances on the
21

21

25


highest agent count in terms of success. However, SCRIMP
also demonstrates signicantly lower CO values than our
methods across all successful warehouse instances attribut-
ing to its efcient multi-agent training. A critical factor for
online planners is the ofine training investment. For in-

6 Conclusions
Our hybrid framework combines decentralized RL-based
planning with only minimal, targeted coordinated alertsŒ
static conict cell ags or brief conict tracksŒto maintain
better SR across various challenging scenarios. While it in-
curs more collisions (CO) and sometimes longer makespan
(MS)comparedtohighlyspecializedmethodslikeSCRIMP,
and its SR declines in extremely dense scenarios, it often
delivers better overall feasibility and scalability, in scenar-
ios with increasing agent counts, than purely search-based
methods and PRIMAL by strategically sharing minimum
inter-agentinformation.
Effectivemulti-agentcoordinationwithreducedinforma-
tion exchange, as explored in this research, will lead to
privacy-aware automated systems, enabling broader use in
complex privacy-preserving applications like autonomous
driving. Despite these promising results, our work has limi-
tations. The current framework, optimized for
disappear at
target
setting,mayfacechallengesin
stayattarget
behavior.
Future work will investigate the minimal information nec-
essary to effectively manage these
stay at target
scenarios,
aimingtoextendtheframework'sapplicabilitywithoutcom-
promisingitscoreprincipleofsparseinformationexchange.
Additionally, an ablation study of richer
AlertMask
en-
codings, like dynamic occupancy maps, could improve re-
planningefciency.

A.1 AQuantitativeModelofInformationLoad
To quantitatively support our claim of reduced informa-
tion sharing, we developed a simplied model to esti-
mate the ﬂTotal Information Loadﬂ of different coordina-
tion paradigms. This model is based on a simple
Informa-
tionUnit(IU)
,denedasthedatarequiredtorepresentone
agent'sstate(e.g.,itscoordinates)atasingletimestep.
Model Assumptions
Our calculation is based on the
11x11 maze scenario with 20 agents
, using metrics from
thesuccessful
Alert-BFS
runsinTable1a.
1.
Scenario Data:
We use a 20-agent instance (N=20)
solved with a makespan (T) of
27 timesteps
and requir-
ingtheresolutionof
191conicts
(C).
2.
AveragePathLength(L):
Weassumeanaverageinitial
pathlengthof
25steps
peragent.
3.
Agent Density (D):
For a distributed method like PRI-
MAL with a 10x10 FoV on an 11x11 grid, each agent
has near-global vision. Therefore, each agent continu-
ously observes all other N-1 agents. We set the average
density(D)to
19neighbors
.
4.

Conict-Based Search (CBS)
S1 Œ Agent Planning: De-
centralized
: Each agent independently computes its path
from the start to the goal using a single-agent pathnding
algorithm (e.g.,
A

). This decentralized planning allows for
efcient initial path computation without considering other
agents.
S2 Œ Collision Detection: Centralized
: After individual
paths are planned, CBS centrally examines these paths to
detectconicts,suchastwoagentsoccupyingthesameloca-
tionatthesametime(vertexconicts)orswappingpositions
simultaneously (edge conicts). This centralized detection
ensuressystematicidenticationofallpotentialconicts.
S3 Œ Collision Avoidance Policy: Centralized
: Upon de-
tecting a conict, CBS resolves it by adding constraints to
the agents' paths. Specically, it creates two new branches
inaconstrainttree,eachimposingarestrictionononeofthe
conictingagentstoavoidtheconict.Thiscentralizedpol-
icyensuresoptimalconictresolutionbyexploringdifferent
constraintcombinations(Sharonetal.2015).
S4 Œ Agent Replanning: Decentralized
: With new con-
straintsinplace,onlytheagentsaffectedbytheseconstraints
replan their paths. Each affected agent independently com-
putesanewpaththatadherestotheaddedconstraints,main-
tainingthedecentralizednatureofthereplanningprocess.
Large Neighborhood Search (LNS)
S1 Œ Agent Plan-
ning: Centralized
: LNS-based methods, such as MAPF-
LNS2, begin with a centralized planning phase where ini-
tial paths for all agents are computed using a fast, subopti-
mal solver like Prioritized Planning (PP). This initial solu-
tion may contain conicts but serves as a starting point for
furtherrenement(Lietal.2022).
S2 Œ Collision Detection: Centralized
: The system cen-
trally identies conicts (e.g., vertex or edge collisions) in
the initial set of paths. This global analysis ensures that all
potential conicts are detected and can be addressed in sub-
sequentsteps.
S3 Œ Collision Avoidance Policy: Centralized
: LNS em-
ploys a centralized strategy to resolve conicts by select-
ing subsets of agents (the ﬂneighborhoodﬂ) involved in col-
lisions and replanning their paths. Techniques like Safe In-
terval Path Planning with Soft Constraints (SIPPS) are used
to minimize the number of conicts during this replanning
phase.
S4 Œ Agent Replanning: Centralized
: The selected subset
of agents undergoes centralized replanning to resolve con-
icts, while the paths of other agents remain unchanged.
This process iterates, with different neighborhoods selected
ineachiteration,untilaconict-freesetofpathsisachieved
orapredenedtimelimitisreached.
PRIMAL and PRIMAL2
S1 Œ Agent Planning: Dis-
tributed
: In both PRIMAL and PRIMAL2, each agent in-
dependently plans its path using policies learned through a
combination of RL and IL. These policies are trained to en-
ableagentstonavigatetowardstheirgoalsbasedonlocalob-
servations without centralized coordination (Sartoretti et al.
2019;Damanietal.2021b).

S3 Œ Collision Avoidance Policy: Distributed
: Collision
avoidance is handled through the agents' learned behaviors.
In PRIMAL2, enhancements such as improved observation
types have been introduced to facilitate better implicit co-
ordination among agents, especially in dense and structured
environments.
S4ŒAgentReplanning:Distributed
:Agentscontinuously
replan their paths in response to changes in their local envi-
ronment. This reactive planning allows them to adapt to dy-
namic scenarios, such as new goal assignments in lifelong
MAPFsettings.
SCRIMP
S1 Œ Agent Planning: Distributed
: Each agent
independently plans its path using a policy learned through
a combination of RL and IL. Agents rely on a small local
FOV (as small as 3×3) and a transformer-based communi-
cation mechanism to share information with nearby agents,
enabling them to make informed decisions despite limited
localobservations(Wangetal.2023).
S2 Œ Collision Detection: Distributed
: Agents detect po-
tential collisions based on their local observations and the
messages received from neighboring agents through the
communicationmechanism.Thisdecentralizedapproachal-
lowsagentstoanticipateandrespondtonearbyagentswith-
outcentralizedcoordination.
S3 Œ Collision Avoidance Policy: Distributed
: Collision
avoidance is handled through the agents' learned policies,
which incorporate a state-value-based tie-breaking strategy.
This strategy enables agents to resolve conicts in symmet-
ricsituationsbyassigningprioritiesbasedonpredictedlong-
termcollectivebenetsanddistancestogoals.
S4ŒAgentReplanning:Distributed
:Agentscontinuously

vironment, leveraging intrinsic rewards to encourage explo-

This decentralized replanning allows agents to adapt to dy-

Learn to Follow (FOLLOWER)
S1 Œ Agent Planning:
Decentralized
: Each agent independently plans its path to
the assigned goal using a heuristic search algorithm (e.g.,
A*). To mitigate congestion, the planner incorporates a
heatmap-basedcostfunctionthatpenalizesfrequentlyoccu-
piedareas,encouragingagentstochooselesscrowdedpaths.
A sub-goal (waypoint) is selected along the planned path to
guideshort-termmovement(Skrynniketal.2024).
S2 Œ Collision Detection: Decentralized
: Agents detect
potential collisions based on their local observations. They
do not rely on a centralized system to identify conicts but
instead use their learned policies to anticipate and respond
tonearbyagents.
S3 Œ Collision Avoidance Policy: Decentralized
: Colli-
sion avoidance is handled through the agents' learned be-
haviors. A neural network-based policy guides the agent to-
ward its sub-goal while avoiding collisions. The policy is
trainedusingreinforcementlearning,leveraginglocalobser-
vations without requiring global state information or inter-
agentcommunication.

: LNS2+RL em-
ploys a hybrid strategy for collision avoidance:
Early Iter-
ations:
Utilizes a MARL policy to replan paths for subsets
of agents involved in conicts. This decentralized compo-
nent allows agents to learn cooperative behaviors to avoid
collisions.
Later Iterations:
Switches to a centralized PP
algorithm for replanning, aiming to quickly resolve any re-
mainingconicts.
