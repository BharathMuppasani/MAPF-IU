=== Global Cleanup ===
Trimming trailing WAITs across all agents...
  Global makespan: 48 (max plan was 54)
  Agent 3: trimmed 3 steps (was 51, now 48)
  Agent 7: trimmed 6 steps (was 54, now 48)
  Agent 10: trimmed 2 steps (was 50, now 48)
  All plans now synchronized to length 48
  Re-simulating all trajectories to match trimmed plans...
  [DEBUG] After re-simulation:
    Plan lengths: [48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48]
    Traj lengths: [49, 49, 49, 49, 49, 49, 49, 49, 49, 49]
    ✓ All trajectories synchronized to length 49
Global cleanup complete: trimmed 3 agents, padded 0 agents, re-simulated all trajectories

=== Synchronized WAIT Removal ===
  No synchronized WAITs to remove

=== Final Collision Check (after cleanup) ===
[DEBUG] Trajectory lengths after cleanup: [49, 49, 49, 49, 49, 49, 49, 49, 49, 49]
