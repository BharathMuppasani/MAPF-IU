=== Global Cleanup ===
Trimming trailing WAITs across all agents...
  Global makespan: 41 (max plan was 44)
  Agent 4: trimmed 3 steps (was 44, now 41)
  Agent 5: trimmed 2 steps (was 43, now 41)
  All plans now synchronized to length 41
  Re-simulating all trajectories to match trimmed plans...
  [DEBUG] After re-simulation:
    Plan lengths: [41, 41, 41, 41, 41, 41, 41, 41, 41, 41]
    Traj lengths: [42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42]
    ✓ All trajectories synchronized to length 42
Global cleanup complete: trimmed 2 agents, padded 0 agents, re-simulated all trajectories

=== Synchronized WAIT Removal ===
  No synchronized WAITs to remove

=== Final Collision Check (after cleanup) ===
[DEBUG] Trajectory lengths after cleanup: [42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42]
