=== Global Cleanup ===
Trimming trailing WAITs across all agents...
  Global makespan: 52 (max plan was 55)
  Agent 9: trimmed 2 steps (was 54, now 52)
  Agent 10: trimmed 3 steps (was 55, now 52)
  All plans now synchronized to length 52
  Re-simulating all trajectories to match trimmed plans...
  [DEBUG] After re-simulation:
    Plan lengths: [52, 52, 52, 52, 52, 52, 52, 52, 52, 52]
    Traj lengths: [53, 53, 53, 53, 53, 53, 53, 53, 53, 53]
    ✓ All trajectories synchronized to length 53
Global cleanup complete: trimmed 2 agents, padded 0 agents, re-simulated all trajectories

=== Synchronized WAIT Removal ===
  No synchronized WAITs to remove

=== Final Collision Check (after cleanup) ===
[DEBUG] Trajectory lengths after cleanup: [53, 53, 53, 53, 53, 53, 53, 53, 53, 53]
