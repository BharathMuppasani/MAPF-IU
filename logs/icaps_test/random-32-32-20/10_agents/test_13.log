    → Agent 4 at goal (19, 4)
    ✓ [C++] Found yield-on-goal plan via parking (18, 4)
      Spliced plan: 11 prefix + 2 yield + 39 suffix = 52 total actions
    ✓ Agent 4 yielded to parking cell (18, 4)

=== Global Cleanup ===
Trimming trailing WAITs across all agents...
  Global makespan: 50 (max plan was 52)
  Agent 4: trimmed 2 steps (was 52, now 50)
  Agent 5: trimmed 2 steps (was 52, now 50)
  All plans now synchronized to length 50
  Re-simulating all trajectories to match trimmed plans...
  [DEBUG] After re-simulation:
    Plan lengths: [50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50]
    Traj lengths: [51, 51, 51, 51, 51, 51, 51, 51, 51, 51]
    ✓ All trajectories synchronized to length 51
Global cleanup complete: trimmed 2 agents, padded 0 agents, re-simulated all trajectories

=== Synchronized WAIT Removal ===
  No synchronized WAITs to remove

=== Final Collision Check (after cleanup) ===
[DEBUG] Trajectory lengths after cleanup: [51, 51, 51, 51, 51, 51, 51, 51, 51, 51]
