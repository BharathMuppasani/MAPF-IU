=== Global Cleanup ===
Trimming trailing WAITs across all agents...
  Global makespan: 53 (max plan was 57)
  Agent 4: trimmed 4 steps (was 57, now 53)
  Agent 7: trimmed 3 steps (was 56, now 53)
  Agent 9: trimmed 4 steps (was 57, now 53)
  Agent 10: trimmed 1 steps (was 54, now 53)
  All plans now synchronized to length 53
  Re-simulating all trajectories to match trimmed plans...
  [DEBUG] After re-simulation:
    Plan lengths: [53, 53, 53, 53, 53, 53, 53, 53, 53, 53]
    Traj lengths: [54, 54, 54, 54, 54, 54, 54, 54, 54, 54]
    ✓ All trajectories synchronized to length 54
Global cleanup complete: trimmed 4 agents, padded 0 agents, re-simulated all trajectories

=== Synchronized WAIT Removal ===
  No synchronized WAITs to remove

=== Final Collision Check (after cleanup) ===
[DEBUG] Trajectory lengths after cleanup: [54, 54, 54, 54, 54, 54, 54, 54, 54, 54]
