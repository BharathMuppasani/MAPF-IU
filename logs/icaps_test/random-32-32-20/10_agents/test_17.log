=== Global Cleanup ===
Trimming trailing WAITs across all agents...
  Global makespan: 55 (max plan was 57)
  Agent 1: trimmed 2 steps (was 57, now 55)
  All plans now synchronized to length 55
  Re-simulating all trajectories to match trimmed plans...
  [DEBUG] After re-simulation:
    Plan lengths: [55, 55, 55, 55, 55, 55, 55, 55, 55, 55]
    Traj lengths: [56, 56, 56, 56, 56, 56, 56, 56, 56, 56]
    ✓ All trajectories synchronized to length 56
Global cleanup complete: trimmed 1 agents, padded 0 agents, re-simulated all trajectories

=== Synchronized WAIT Removal ===
  No synchronized WAITs to remove
